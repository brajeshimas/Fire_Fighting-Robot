## 🚀 Features

- 🔥 **Flame detection** using IR-based flame sensors
- 🚗 **Obstacle avoidance** (if applicable)
- 💨 **DC fan or pump** to extinguish fire
- 📱 **Manual control** using Bluetooth + Android app
- 🧠 Autonomous scanning mode for searching and putting out fires

## 🧰 Technologies & Components Used

- **Microcontroller**: 8051 / AVR / Arduino (specify what you used)
- **Sensors**: Flame sensor (IR), optional gas sensor
- **Actuators**: DC motors for movement, fan/pump for extinguishing
- **Wireless**: Bluetooth module (e.g., HC-05) for manual control
- **Programming Language**: Embedded C / Arduino
- **Control Interface**: Android mobile app (manual mode)
- **Tools**: Keil uVision / Arduino IDE / Proteus (if simulation done)
